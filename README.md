This document is a brief outline of what I would have done had I been given more time.

Backend - API
- I would have splitted the backend into multiple tiers
- I would have implemented more endpoints such as:-
    - GetAllReviewsForPub(string pubName)
    - GetAllPubsWithinRange(decimal miles) etc
- Consider security


Fron-end
- I would have implemented the frontend using Angular
- I would also add search, filter and pagination features

Infrastructure
- I would have used docker containers
- I would also split the solution into smaller microservices
